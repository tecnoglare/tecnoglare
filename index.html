            <p>As you navigate through and interact with our Website and mobile applications, we may use automatic data collection technologies to collect certain information about you, your equipment, browsing actions, and patterns, including:</p>

            <ul>

            <p>The information we collect automatically is statistical data and may also include personal information, or we may maintain it or associate it with personal information we collect in other ways or receive from third parties.

            <h3><strong>What are Cookies?</strong></h3>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cookies (or browser cookies)</strong>. A cookie is a small file placed on the hard drive of your computer. Note that while you can set your browser to not allow cookies, we may not be able to honour that request, and may track your activity and collect information about you and your online activities even when the browser is set to “do not track.”</li>
                <li><strong>Flash Cookies</strong>. Certain features of our Website may use local stored objects (or Flash cookies) to collect and store information about your preferences and navigation to, from, and on our Website. Flash cookies are not managed by the same browser settings as are used for browser cookies and you may not be able to shut down our collection of and use of information through this technology.</li>
                <li><strong>Web Beacons</strong>. Pages of our Website and our e-mails may contain small electronic files known as web beacons (also referred to as clear gifs, pixel tags, and single-pixel gifs) that permit the Company, for example, to count users who have visited those pages or opened an email and for other related website statistics (for example, recording the popularity of certain website content and verifying system and server integrity). Flash cookies are not managed by the same browser settings as are used for browser cookies and you may not be able to shut down our collection of and use of information through this technology.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>How Do We Use Cookies?</h3>

            <p>We use cookies to enable certain functionality and help us provide a better experience on our Website, including:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>To identify returning users, registrants, and subscribers and to allow them to be presented with a personalized version of the Website.</li>
                <li>To eliminate the need for returning users to re-enter their login details.</li>
                <li>To measure users’ behaviour to better develop our Website. For example, we can use cookies to look at patterns of searches you conduct on our Website. We can use such analysis to gain insights about how to improve the functionality and user experience of the Website.</li>
                <li>To manage online advertising.</li>
                <li>We use cookies to gather certain information about users, such as browser type, server, language preference, and country setting, in order to store user preferences on our Website to make your user experience more consistent and convenient. For example, we may store the recent searches you have performed in a cookie so that we can allow you to easily repeat those searches when you return to our Website.</li>
                <li>To associate user activity with the third party website that referred the user to our Website.</li>
                <li>To determine your geographic location in order to provide you with the most relevant search results.</li>
                <li>To associate user activity with the email campaign that referred the user to our Site</li>
            </ul>

            <h3><strong>Managing Cookies</strong></h3>

            <p>Use the options in your web browser if you do not wish to receive a cookie or if you wish to set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie. You can usually delete and manage any cookies that have been installed in the cookie folder of your browser as well. Note that some cookies cannot be removed this way, such as persistent cookies. Please refer to Section above titled “What are Cookies?” for more information on the types of cookies you can manage using your browser settings.</p>

            <p>You may also consult your mobile device documentation for information on how to disable cookies on your mobile device. However, if you disable all cookies, you may not be able to take advantage of all the features of this Website.</p>

            <h3><strong>Google Analytics</strong></h3>

            <p>We use Google Analytics, a service provided by Google, Inc. (“<strong>Google</strong>”) to analyse traffic on our Website. Google utilizes the data collected to track and examine the use of our Website, and to prepare reports for us based on your activities online, among other uses. As part of Google Analytics, Google tracks many variables, including what website you visited prior to coming to our Website, how long you stay on a particular page, and your geographic location.</p>

            <h3><strong>Do Not Track</strong></h3>

            <p>Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a concept promoted by certain regulatory authorities and industry groups for development and implementation of a mechanism that would allow internet users to control the tracking of their online activities across websites. Currently, various browsers (including Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari) offer a DNT option that allows a user to set a preference in the browser to not have his/her activities on the internet tracked. You can usually access your browser’s DNT option in your browser’s preferences. When a user’s browser is set to DNT, some cookies and other tracking technologies may become inactive, depending on how the website visited responds to DNT browser settings. If that occurs, the website visited will not recognize you upon return to that website, save your passwords or usernames, and some other features of a website may become unavailable or not function properly.</p>

            <p>Given that there is no recognized industry standard approach to DNT settings, our website does not currently respond to DNT settings at this time.</p>

            <h3><strong>Third-Party Use of Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies</strong></h3>

            <p>Some content or applications, including advertisements, on the Website may be served by third-parties, including advertisers, ad networks and servers, content providers, and application providers. These third parties may use cookies alone or in conjunction with web beacons or other tracking technologies to collect information about you when you use our Website. The information they collect may be associated with your personal information or they may collect information, including personal information, about your online activities over time and across different websites and other online services. They may use this information to provide you with interest-based (behavioural) advertising or other targeted content.</p>

            <h3><strong>How We Use Your Information</strong></h3>

            <p>We may use information that we collect about you or that you provide to us, including any personal information:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>To present our Website and its contents to you.</li>

            </ul>

            <h3><strong>Data Security</strong></h3>

            <p>We have implemented measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration, and disclosure.</p>

            <p>The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of our Website, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone and to change your password from time to time. We also highly recommend that you use a password that is dissimilar to and cannot be easily found by unauthorized third parties who may have obtained your login credentials to other sites. Keep in mind that if you use the same password for all websites, if someone obtains your credentials for one site, they may be able to then use those credentials to log into any other site you use.</p>

            <p>Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we try to protect your personal information by implementing Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) is an extension of the&nbsp;<strong>Hypertext Transfer Protocol</strong>&nbsp;(HTTP). It is used for secure communication over a computer network, and is widely used on the Internet, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information transmitted through or collected through the use of our Website. Any transmission of personal information is at your own risk.</p>

            <p>We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Website.</p>

            <h3><strong>Changes to Our Privacy Policy</strong></h3>

            <p>It is our policy to post any changes we make to this Privacy Policy on this page. If we make material changes to how we treat our users’ personal information, we will notify you by email to the email address specified in your account. We may also post a notice on the Website home page. The date this Privacy Policy was last revised is identified at the top of the page. You are responsible for ensuring we have an up-to-date active and deliverable email address for you, and for periodically visiting our Website and this Privacy Policy to check for any changes.</p>

            <p>You have the right to request that we disclose certain information to you about our collection and use of your personal information over the past 12 months. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will disclose to you:</p>

                <li>disclosures for a business purpose, identifying the personal information categories that each category of recipient obtained.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>We do not provide these access and data portability rights for B2B personal information.</p>

            <h3>Deletion Request Rights</h3>

            <p>You have the right to request that we delete any of your personal information that we collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request submitted via email at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:privacy@tecnoglare.com" target="_blank">privacy@tecnoglare.com</a>&nbsp;we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your personal information from our records, unless an exception applies.</p>

            <p>We may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for us or our service provider(s) to:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Complete the transaction for which we collected the personal information, provide a good or service that you requested, take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with you, fulfil the terms of a written warranty or product recall conducted in accordance with federal law, or otherwise perform our contract with you.</li>
                <li>Detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or prosecute those responsible for such activities.</li>

                <li>Comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act (Cal. Penal Code § 1546 et. seq.).</li>
                <li>Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research in the public interest that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws, when the information’s deletion may likely render impossible or seriously impair the research’s achievement, if you previously provided informed consent.</li>
                <li>Enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with consumer expectations based on your relationship with us.</li>
                <li>Comply with a legal obligation.</li>
                <li>Make other internal and lawful uses of that information that are compatible with the context in which you provided it.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>We do not provide these deletion rights for B2B personal information.</p>

            <h3>Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights</h3>

            <p>To exercise the access, data portability, and deletion rights described above, please submit a verifiable consumer request to us by either.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Emailing us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:privacy@tecnoglare.com" target="_blank">privacy@tecnoglare.com</a></li>
            </ul>

            <p>Only you, or someone legally authorized to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information. You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child.</p>

            <p>You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period. The verifiable consumer request must:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative.</li>
                <li>Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you</p>

            <p>Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us.</p>

            <p>We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request submitted via email at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:privacy@tecnoglare.com" target="_blank">privacy@tecnoglare.com</a>&nbsp;to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request.</p>

            <h3>Response Timing and Format</h3>

            <p>We endeavour to respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days of its receipt. If we require more time (up to 45 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.</p>

            <p>If you have an account with us, we will deliver our written response to your email associated with that account. If you do not have an account with us, we will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option.</p>

            <p>Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request’s receipt. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.</p>

            <p>We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.</p>

            <h3>Personal Information Sales Opt-Out and Opt-In Rights</h3>

            <p>If you are 16 years of age or older, you have the right to direct us to not sell your personal information at any time (the “right to opt-out”). We will not sell the personal information of consumers we actually know are less than 16 years of age, unless we receive affirmative authorization (the “right to opt-in”) from either the consumer who is at least 13 but not yet 16 years of age, or the parent or guardian of a consumer less than 13 years of age. Consumers who opt-in to personal information sales may opt-out of future sales at any time. To exercise the right to opt-out, you (or your authorized representative) may submit a request to us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:privacy@tecnoglare.com" target="_blank">privacy@tecnoglare.com</a>.</p>

            <p>Once you make an opt-out request, we will wait at least twelve (12) months before asking you to reauthorize personal information sales. However, you may change your mind and opt back into personal information sales at any time by emailing us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:privacy@tecnoglare.com" target="_blank">privacy@tecnoglare.com</a>.</p>

            <p>You do not need to create an account with us to exercise your opt-out rights. We will only use personal information provided in an opt-out request to review and comply with the request.</p>

            <h3>Non-Discrimination</h3>

            <p>We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights. Unless permitted by the CCPA, we will not:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Deny you goods or services.</li>
                <li>Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties.</li>
                <li>Provide you a different level or quality of products or services.</li>
                <li>Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for products or services or a different level or quality of products or services.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Other California Privacy Rights</h2>

            <p>California Civil Code Section 1798.83, known as the “Shine The Light” law, permits our customers who are California residents to request and obtain from us a list of what personal information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year and the names and addresses of those third parties. Requests may be made only once a year and are free of charge.&nbsp;<em>Under Section 1798.83, we currently do not share any personal information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes, except with our affiliates.</em></p>

            <p>Note that, as stated in the ‘Information We Collect Through Automatic Data Collection Technologies’ under our General Privacy Policy above, we may use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect information about your online activities over time and across third-party websites or other online services (behavioural tracking).</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Request access to your personal data (commonly known as a “data subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.</li>
                <li>Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.</li>
                <li>Request erasure of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.</li>
                <li>Object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.</li>
                <li>Request restriction of processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data’s accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</li>
                <li>Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.</li>
                <li>Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.</li>
